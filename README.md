# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in C  
This is a basic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using the C programming language. It runs in the console and allows two players to take turns choosing positions on a 3×3 grid. After each round, the game can restart, making it easy to play again without relaunching the program.  
## What the Program Does  
- Shows a 3x3 board with position numbers  
- Accepts player input and updates the board  
- Checks for winning conditions or a draw  
- Offers a replay option after each game  
- Handles invalid input and resets the board properly  
## What I Practiced  
- Writing clean, reusable code with functions  
- Validating and handling user input  
- Designing game loops and replay logic  
- Using GDB to debug and trace issues  
## Tools Used  
- Language: C  
- Compiler: GCC  
- Debugger: GDB  
## How to Run  
1. Compile the code:  
```bash  
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe  
```  
2. Run the game:  
```bash  
./tic_tac_toe  
```
